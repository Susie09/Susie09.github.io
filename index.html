<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>I am a final year Ph.D. student in Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at The University of Hong Kong since 2014, under the supervision of Prof. Victor O.K. Li. I received my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in 2013. I was a visiting student with the Tsinghua Natural Language Processing Group from Nov 2016 to April 2017, worked with <a href="http://thunlp.org/~ly/">Prof. Yang Liu</a>. I was a visiting student with NYU CILVR Group from Oct 2017 to April 2018, worked with <a href="http://www.kyunghyuncho.me/">Prof. Kyunghyun Cho</a> and <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/">Prof. Sam Bowman</a>. </p>
<p>I have interests in several broad research directions, such as natural language processing, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
